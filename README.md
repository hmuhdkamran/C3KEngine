# C3K Engine
## Overview

This framework is designed to support a microservices architecture, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing various services within an enterprise. Each service is developed to be independent, ensuring modularity, ease of maintenance, and the flexibility to deploy and scale components independently.
Key Features

    Modular Architecture: Each service is developed as an independent module, promoting reusability and maintainability.
    Scalability: The framework supports scaling services independently based on demand.
    Security: Authentication and authorization mechanisms are integrated to secure the services.
    Inter-Service Communication: Efficient and secure communication between services.
    Extensibility: Easily extend the framework by adding new services.
